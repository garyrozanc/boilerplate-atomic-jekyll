Definition list

A definition list is used for displaying terms and each followed by a definition list. If you quickly need a definition list, you can use the definition list generator tool that creates the HTML code for the terms and definitions you submit. A definition list starts with the <dl> tag. Each term in the definition list is listed with the <dt> tag. Finally, the definition for the term is listed with the <dd> tag. Let's work with an example that will produce the following output:

Network
    A number of computers or other devices connected to share information and resources.
Multitasking
    The ability of CPU to run two or more programs independently at the same time.
File Management
    Organization and tracking of files.

To create this list, we will first use the <dl> tag to start the definition list. Next, to list the term we will use the <dt> tag. The first term we want to define is "Network" thus it will contained in the <dt> tag as <dt>Network</dt>. To list the definition for the term, we will use the <dd> tag, as shown below:
